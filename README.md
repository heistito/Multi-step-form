##Multi-Step Form

##Overview
This project is a multi-step form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It provides an interactive and user-friendly way to collect data across multiple steps or pages. 
This form can be used for various purposes such as registration processes, surveys, and any other scenario where a single-page form is not practical.


##Features

User-Friendly Navigation: Users can easily navigate the form steps using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Progress Indicator: A progress bar at the top indicates the current step and overall progress.

Form Validation: Each step includes client-side validation to ensure data integrity before proceeding to the next step.

Responsive Design: The form is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Smooth Transitions: CSS transitions provide a soft and visually appealing experience when moving between steps.
